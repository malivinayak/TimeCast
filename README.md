## The Core Mechanic

Stand still and the world nearly freezes — bullets hang in the air, enemies mid-step.

Move, aim, or shoot and everything snaps back to full speed. Every step is a decision. Every bullet you dodge was dodged on purpose.

Your gun holds **6 rounds** and reloads automatically when empty. Reload time is also frozen while you're still, so plan your shots.

## Levels

The game has x levels. We won't spoil them here — just play.
